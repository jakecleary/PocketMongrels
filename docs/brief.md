Mediatonic Code Test
====================

We ask all engineering applicants to complete a take-home coding test. We try to keep the challenge 
as simple as possible so it can be completed in a reasonable amount of time but are really looking 
to learn about how you'd approach, and the type of architecture you'd use for more complex projects 
so encourage you to treat it as a prototype which is likely to be expanded upon in the future. 

For the coding test, we'd like you to build a HTTP API which could be used to power a simple virtual
pet style game, where:

- Users have animals
- Petting animals makes them happy
- Feeding animals makes them less hungry
- Animals start "neutral" on both metrics
- Happiness decreases over time / hunger increases over time
- Users can own multiple animals of different types
- Different animal types have metrics which increase/decrease at different rates

Use a technology of your choice (although ideally C#/ASP.NET) to design an API around this idea. 
We'd like to see tests, but don't worry about a GUI. Please provide instructions to run the 
solution and any notes or comments if you feel appropriate.

We don't take into account the time taken to complete the solution, so don't feel like you have 
to rush it.
